# fifa-world-cup-data-analysis

This project automates the scraping of fifa world cup data data using selenium and storing that data in a postgres database. The database is configured and hosted in a docket container. The data is then used to build interactive analytics dashboards using both jupyter notebooks and Dash.

# Learning

By the begining of this project I did not have any technical knowledge using selenium. I tried winging the project but I could not pull it through. I therefore decided to learn selenium first before attampting the project. All my practise files are in the learning_selenium folder.
